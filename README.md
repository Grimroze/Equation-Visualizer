 ðŸ“ˆ 2D & 3D Equation Visualizer by grimroze

This is a Python-based CLI tool that allows you to input and visualize multiple mathematical equations in **2D** and **3D** using `matplotlib` and `numexpr`. You can plot functions like `sin(x)`, `x**2 + y**2`, or even combinations like `sin(tan(cos(x + tan(x)) + y) + y)` interactively.
